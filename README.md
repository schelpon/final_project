# RCES Final Project Proposal 
## Sofia Chelpon

### Goal 
The goal of my project is to compare the data collected during the Convective Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) field campaign which took place during the winter of 2014 to the forecast model runs made for the mission. My hypothesis is that the model will be fairly accurate in general distribution of chemical species, but may differ in exact magnitude. 

### Analysis Summary 
I will use a combination of tabular and data, which I will handle using Pandas, as well as multidimensional model data which I will handle using xarray. The analysis will consist of plots that compare the distribution and magnitude of concentrations of a few chemical species, including map plots of the model (including geography from cartopy), along-flight species concentrations. Some simple statistical comparisons will be done including figures such as histograms will be used as well. 

### Data Used
Flight data will be ordered using the CONTRAST Data Sets hosted by the Earth Observing Laboratory, which can be found at the following site. Specifically I will be using the data from the Trace Gas Organic Analyzer (TOGA) instrument

The model run is a specified dynamics run of the CAM-chem model provided by the forecasting team, which has been shared with me by a member of my research group.
